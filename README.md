# 👋 Hi, I'm Bhavik Sevak

🎓 I’m a Computer Science student with a strong interest in **backend development** and **database management systems (DBMS)**.  
💡 I specialize in **Java** and **Spring Boot**, focusing on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.  
🧠 I enjoy understanding how systems work internally — from how APIs connect to databases, to how data is processed efficiently.  
🚀 My long-term goal is to become a **skilled backend engineer** who builds reliable and scalable software solutions.
