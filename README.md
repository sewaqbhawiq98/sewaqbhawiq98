# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bhavik Sevak

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a Computer Science student with a strong interest in **backend development** and **database management systems (DBMS)**.  
ðŸ’¡ I specialize in **Java** and **Spring Boot**, focusing on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.  
ðŸ§  I enjoy understanding how systems work internally â€” from how APIs connect to databases, to how data is processed efficiently.  
ðŸš€ My long-term goal is to become a **skilled backend engineer** who builds reliable and scalable software solutions.
